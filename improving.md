# Improving

## Replays

At the end of each match, press "A, A, Y" and save a replay

Immediately go into the vault and view the replay data

Pause, then press Z to go frame-by-frame

Make note of your mistakes and how they were punished

Pick only one item you wish to improve

Practice against a level 8 CPU with that improvement in mind

Play another human opponent, and start the cycle again

## Improving your improvement

Eventually after a match you will be able to go over in your head what the most noticeable mistake was

Immediately play another match while making that improvement

Soon, you may find yourself noticing your mistakes during the match

When you make one mistake, don't make it again for the rest of the match
