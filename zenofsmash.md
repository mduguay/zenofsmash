# The Zen of Smash

Stop fighting the CPU

If you’ve spent hundreds of hours fighting the CPU, then that’s hundreds of hours you’ll have to un-learn. Things that work against the CPU will not work against humans, and vice-versa. Humans are quicker to learn, and much less forgiving.

Get a LAN adapter

The game will sync to the laggiest player, and you don’t want that player to be you. The more people that are in a fight, the more likely it is to lag. A wired ethernet connection will beat out even the fastest wi-fi.

Fight online

The battles will be tough, but don’t throw ultimates, weird stages, multiple players, and items into the mix until you’ve mastered the basics.

Analyze the replay

Use Z to slow it down frame by frame. Keep a written record of your mistakes, and how they were punished. You’ll have a LOT of material to work with.

Practice

Focus on one bad habit.
