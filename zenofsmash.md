# The Zen of Smash

## Mantras

Keep your eyes on the opponent.

Breathe. Pace the game.

Mix it up.

Never give up.

It’s not about winning, it’s about improving.

## Warm Up

### Training Mode

Short hop / fast fall

RAR

Walking

Dash grab vs. standing grab

Pivot grab

Turning around while walking.

Dashing - Change direction without 'skidding'

Choose one bread and butter combo

### Movement

Set the CPU Behavior to Lv. 3

Practice keeping away from the opponent without rolling.

Avoid getting hit just by moving, jumping, and sheilding.

No rolling! Rolling is always punishable, and gets worse and worse the more you use it.

Short hop / fast fall as you're doing this.

### Getting out of your sheild

Rolling is slow and punishable

Jumping is a better option

### Smash: 3 minute drills

Go into Smash and create a rule: 

Style: Stock
Stock: 3
Time Limit: 3:00
FS Meter: Off
Spirits: Off
CPU Lv. 1
Stage Selection: Battlefield & Omega
Items: None

### Offense

3 stock the CPU while playing as perfectly as possible.

Keep in mind the mantras.

Be intentional with your moves.

Land every attack that you throw out.

Never take damage.

Throw in a different direction each time.

Recover from the ledge a different way each time.

Hit your bread and butter combos.

If you land a string of attacks, keep in mind if it's a true combo or just a juggle.

Too easy? Try setting the CPU to level 2.

### Defense

Repetitive, but simple motions. Things you want to burn into muscle memory. Intentional drilling.

—

Fight online

Recommended to start with 1v1, battlefield, items off, ultimates off

The battles will be tough, but don’t throw ultimates, weird stages, multiple players, and items into the mix until you’ve mastered the basics.

Save that replay

—

Analyze the replay

Use Z to slow it down frame by frame. Keep a written record of your mistakes, and how they were punished. You’ll have a LOT of material to work with.

Practice

“Practice does not make perfect. Only perfect practice makes perfect”
- Vince Lombardi

Focus on one bad habit.
There are a few things you can do right off the bat that will improve the way you play the game. Consider these prerequisites before you really start training.

---

Stop fighting the CPU

If you’ve spent hundreds of hours fighting the CPU, then that’s hundreds of hours you’ll have to un-learn. Things that work against the CPU will not work against humans, and vice-versa. Humans are quicker to learn, and much less forgiving.

Get a LAN adapter

The game will sync to the laggiest player, and you don’t want that player to be you. The more people that are in a fight, the more likely it is to lag. A wired ethernet connection will beat out even the fastest wi-fi.
