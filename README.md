# Smash Dojo
Learn to smash, and have fun doing it.

## Intro
If you're like me, you've already spent many hours in Smash, getting familiar with all the characters, playing through single player mode, and fighting the CPU.

Then, thinking I'd give it a shot, I went and played online.

And I got SMASHED.

What went wrong? What am I missing? I've beaten high level CPUs and yet when I play a human, there's something I'm completely missing.

If this sounds like you, I've created this guide to help us both on the path to playing Smash like a real human being. These are things I've learned the hard way, and you'll make mistakes too, but don't worry about it. We were all newbies once. I’ve split the main guide into three sections: “Moveset”, “Strategy”, and "Going Online". Feel free to jump around the guide. 

If you end up getting frustrated or bored with a particular exercie, go and beat up a level 3 CPU without losing a life. I find that a level 3 CPU is close to playing a human who just picked up the game for the first time and is figuring out what the buttons do. Focus on good technique rather than just winning.

If you've been playing the CPU, it's time to relearn what you know. Playing the CPU teaches you some very bad habits, and it's tough to break them. I'd almost say that a complete beginner will have an easier time than someone who is conditioned to play against the CPU.

That said, it's in everyone's power to become a better player. If you can learn, you can improve. Pay attention to the details. Soon you'll be holding your own in online mode, pushing the needle of GSP up and up. You may even find yourself looking for chances to play live against other smashers. You've got nowhere to go but up! Now that we're motivated, where do we begin?

## Before You Smash

### Choose a Controller
You have several options to choose from. If you just got a switch, then using the default controller will work fine. A step up from that would be to get a pro-controller. If you want to go old-school, you can get a gamecube controller and adapter. 

### Set Your Control Scheme
Create a nametag and set your default controls. Take note of how your c-stick is configured. You have the option of changing c-stick to tilts instead of smash attacks. You can also turn off tilt jump, so pressing up will not make you jump. This is helpful if you want to execute an up-tilt attack without accidentally jumping. Some people use the shoulder button to jump, so their thumb can always be on the attack button. Try mixing it up and see what works for you! There is no 'correct' control scheme except the one you like.

## Train

### Training Mode
Training mode is your best friend. Get to it by going to Games & More -> Training. Set the stage to be training stage. Just run around and get a feel for your character. Punch up the dummy a little bit.
Use the colored markings to improve precision and measure the distance covered by attacks.

### Practice Mode
Create a smash ruleset that uses only omega and battlefield stages.
Set the CPU to level 1.
Set it to timed mode, and choose a moderate length of time. I like 4 minutes, it's enough to get some practice in without getting boring.
Remember the goal is not to beat the CPU, but to always land your hits.
More practice tips and exercises will come later.

## Choose Your Character

### Try Different Characters
Every fighter is different, from movement speed to jump height to attack range.
Use practice mode and see which character just feels right.
Find a playstyle that you would like to learn.

### Choose a main
Choose whichever character you think is coolest, or one that you can land hits reliably.
As you improve with your main, you will also get better at the fundamentals of all other characters.
The goal of choosing a main is to focus on the very technical aspects, and learn exactly how the character moves and exactly how the attacks come out. You can get very deep on any character in the game. Don't pay any attention to tier lists. This will be the character you can use without thinking.

### Choose a few backups
Somtimes you can get tired of using your main, especially after a long training session. Pick someone else to 'reset' and have some fun. Sometimes your main will be bad against a certain other type of character. It's useful to have a backup incase that happens.

## Part 1: Movement
Let's focus on the tricky parts first! Anyone picking up the game can run and jump, but there is much more to learn if you want to move like a master.

### Walking
Before you can run, you must walk! 
How quickly can you tilt the stick without sprinting? 
Control the speed of your walk. 
Use this to get into a precice position.
```
Exercise: Walk and stop on each colored line as you go across the stage. 
Try to stop directly on each line.
Walk back and forth, changing direction quickly, but without accidentally sprinting.
You can slow down and speed up to increase precision.
```

### Short hopping
This is an important move that many newcomers to smash don't even know exists. If you _tap_ the jump button very quickly, you will short hop. This is about half the height of the full hop, and will come in very useful. The only way to get good at this is to build muscle memory. 

Try to set a record. Short hop while running forward. Short hop in place.
You may notice a lag between the time you think about short hopping, and actually executing it.
The goal of practice is to make it instantanious.

This will take time, and many practice sessions! You will get better each time, and congratulate yourself when you do. Think of it like learning to play an instrument - rote practice and repitition to start out, before you can really 'play'.
```
Exercise 1: Do a standing short hop 5 times in a row.
Once you make it to 5, keep going and see how many you can do.
Keep track of your personal record.
```
```
Exercise 2: Perform a running short hop.
Continue to run across the stage, short hopping as you go. Focus on always short-hopping, without accidentally jumping. As you get better, see how quickly you can short hop one after another.
```

### Fast Falling
On the way down from any jump, you can tilt the control stick down to fall faster. This will help you land more precicely, and my throw off any opponent that is trying to anticipate where you will land. While holding down, you will fall straight through platforms, so use this to keep your feet on the ground on stages like battlefield.

A true fast fall however is done by hitting down at the very top of the jump. You will see a little spark if you do this correctly. This is the quickest way down.
```
Exercise: 
Jump and fast fall 10 times in a row
```

### Short-hop fast-fall
Can you combine the two techniques? This is the quickest possible jump your character can do. Use this to fake out opponents and start combos. It will take a little time to master, but it's a very good tool to have in your pocket.
```
Exercise:
Do 5 consecutive short-hop fast-falls, take your time.
```

### Sprinting
Turn around without going into skid animation.
Stop precicely.
Run up to edge without losing balance.
```
Exercise: Run and stop on each colored line.
Try changing directions as quickly as possible.
Run up to, but do not touch the dummy.
Sprint up to the edge, but don't fall off.
```

### Jumping
Land precicely.
Land in front of and behind the opponent.
```
Exercise: 
Jump and land on each colored line across the stage.
Jump so that the top of your jump is directly above the dummy.
Jump and land just in front of the dummy.
Jump and land just behind the dummy.
```

## Shielding
The goal isn't to react to an attack by shielding, the goal is to anticipate an attack and shield before it comes. Many newcomers to the game attack and attack, so using your shield properly is a sure way to get ahead.

Your shield will shrink on it's own, or if an attack hits it. When it breaks, you will become stunned. Remember a grab goes through a shield.

Perfect sheilding can be done by releasing the shield at the precice moment of the attack.
```
Exercise: Play practice mode against a level 3 CPU. Use your shield to block all incoming attacks. The only time you can attack the CPU is in retaliation after they hit your shield
```
---
## Grabbing
Grabbing is the counter to a shielding opponent.

When you grab, you can throw in 4 different directions, each has a different effect.
```
Exercise: Fight a level 3 CPU and practice your grabs. The CPU will shield at random. When it does, go in for the grab! The other thing to practice is shielding as it attacks and grabbing out of the shield to punish.
```

## Attacks
Finally, I get to smash someone!
### Ground Attacks 

- Neutral
- Tilt
- Dash

### Air Attacks

- Neutral
- Up
- Down
- Forward
- Back

### Short-hop attacks
You have all the air attacks, but executed close to the ground. These are very trickly to pull off, but very rewarding. Focus on hitting the attack button as you are coming down from a short hop.

### Special Attacks

- Neutral
- Side
- Up
- Down

```
Exercise:
Go into practice mode and KO the dummy by using only one move over and over. Focus on always hitting the move.
```

# Part 3: Going Online!
Time to dive in and get some matches under your belt. It may be difficult to start out, but learning is part of the process. Here are some tips for when you start playing.

It may be intimidating at first, but simply playing the game online will give you experience. When you've played for a little while, you'll get a feel for what it's like to really contend, and maybe a sense of what you're up against. You'll win some, you'll lose some. I've found that it's roughly 30% I don't stand a chance, 30% I can notch up a win, and 40% could go either way. 

Here are a few tips to make the most out of your matches when beginning to play online.

## Don't pay attention to GSP
GSP is basically a way to ensure that you'll be playing against people where you have a fighting chance. It's better to have an accurate GSP than it is to have a high GSP. It will take a few rounds to calibrate. If you’ve played classic mode, you will start out with a GSP that is probably higher than you really should be.

## Don’t panic! 
Take your time and try and think about your next move. This can be tricky if your opponent doesn’t give you time to think, but don’t start flailing just to try to hit something. If your opponent is chasing you down, try just dodging and getting out of range for a while as you regroup. Be intentional with your attacks. Don’t forget to shield and grab.

## Fight 'till the end
Don't give up if you're getting whooped. You may always land a few hits, and that feels good. Even if you get three stocked without landing a single hit, it can still be a valuable experience. Don't intentionally suicide, that's just bad sportsmanship.

## Save your replays
This is important! On the final results screen, you'll have a chance to save a replay. Whether you win or lose, there are always lessons to be learned. If you're like me, your first few fights will go by so quickly you won't even know what happened. Having the tape is mandatory if you want to get the most value out of a match.

## Analyze your replays

Everyone makes slightly different mistakes while playing, so this is a chance to tailor your training. Keep a notepad handy and keep a record of lessons learned. Use Z to step through frame by frame. Find out your weak points and start paying attention to them. Sometimes I'll catch a "what was I thinking!?" moment. Don't get discouraged! I've filled pages with things I could have done better, and then I wonder where I should even begin to improve. The point isn’t to be overwhelmed with negatives, but simply to make a note and acknowledge it.

## Keep playing
Every fight is a good fight! Keep playing against humans and you will get better in time. It may take a few rounds, but you will improve nonetheless. Learn to have fun while playing, even when it can get frustrating. Every time you get frustrated it is an opportunity to learn. Win or lose, experience is valuable.
