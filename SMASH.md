# Smash Dojo
Learn to smash, and have fun doing it.

## Intro
If you're like me, you've already spent many hours in Smash, getting familiar with all the characters, playing through single player mode, and fighting the CPU.

Then, thinking I'd give it a shot, I went and played online.

And I got SMASHED.

What went wrong? What am I missing? I've beaten high level CPUs and yet when I play a human, there's something I'm completely missing.

If this sounds like you, I've created this guide to help us both on the path to playing Smash like a real human being. These are things I've learned the hard way, and you'll make mistakes too, but don't worry about it. We were all newbies once. I’ve split the main guide into two sections: “Moveset” and “Strategy”. Start at the beginning! Even if you’re a seasoned veteran, it is still worthwhile to go back over the fundamentals

If you've been playing the CPU, it's time to relearn what you know. Playing the CPU teaches you some very bad habits, and it's tough to break them. I'd almost say that a complete beginner will have an easier time than someone who is conditioned to play against the CPU.

That said, it's in everyone's power to become a better player. If you can learn, you can improve. Pay attention to the details. Soon you'll be holding your own in online mode, pushing the needle of GSP up and up. You may even find yourself looking for chances to play live against other smashers. You've got nowhere to go but up! Now that we're motivated, where do we begin?

## Chapter 1: Dive right in!

It may be intimidating at first, but simply playing the game online will give you experience. When you've played for a little while, you'll get a feel for what it's like to really contend, and maybe a sense of what you're up against. Here are a few tips to make the most out of your matches when beginning to play online.


### Try different characters
The character you like the most may not be the one you’re best with. It’s fun to experiment, and there’s so many characters to choose from, you’d be missing out on a big part of the game by limiting yourself. Stuck in a rut? Try mixing it up. See if you like swords, ranged attacks, quick characters, or slow and powerful characters.

### Don't pay attention to GSP
GSP is basically a way to ensure that you'll be playing against people where you have a fighting chance. It's better to have an accurate GSP than it is to have a high GSP. It will take a few rounds to calibrate. If you’ve played classic mode, you will start out with a GSP that is probably higher than you really should be.

### Don’t panic! 
Take your time and try and think about your next move. This can be tricky if your opponent doesn’t give you time to think, but don’t start flailing just to try to hit something. If your opponent is chasing you down, try just dodging and getting out of range for a while as you regroup. Be intentional with your attacks. Don’t forget to shield and grab.

### Fight 'till the end
Don't give up if you're getting whooped. You may always land a few hits, and that feels good. Even if you get three stocked without landing a single hit, it can still be a valuable experience. Don't intentionally suicide, that's just bad sportsmanship.

### Save your replays
This is important! On the final results screen, you'll have a chance to save a replay. Whether you win or lose, there are always lessons to be learned. If you're like me, your first few fights will go by so quickly you won't even know what happened. Having the tape is mandatory if you want to get the most value out of a match.

### Analyze your replays

Everyone makes slightly different mistakes while playing, so this is a chance to tailor your training. Keep a notepad handy and keep a record of lessons learned. Use Z to step through frame by frame. Find out your weak points and start paying attention to them. Sometimes I'll catch a "what was I thinking!?" moment. Don't get discouraged! I've filled pages with things I could have done better, and then I wonder where I should even begin to improve. The point isn’t to be overwhelmed with negatives, but simply to make a note and acknowledge it.

### Train
Now that you know some areas for improvement, practice practice practice. What do you need to learn? What should you be doing? What should you stop doing? Chances are your mistakes are all a matter of not having the fundamentals hardwired into your system. Practice correcting one particular mistake until you feel like you're ready to bring it to a real fight. When training against a CPU, keep it at level 1. Yup. It should be easy to hit. Any CPU higher than 1 will teach you bad habits. Don’t try to win against a level 1 opponent, just use it as a punching bag. Focus on always landing your attacks and grabs. Focus on never getting hit. Play against an opponent with ranged attacks and practice shielding and moving in. Get up close and try to read an attack and shield then. Try honing in on one particular technique and practice it until it becomes muscle memory.

### Keep playing
Every fight is a good fight! Keep playing against humans and you will get better in time. It may take a few rounds, but you will improve nonetheless. Learn to have fun while playing, even when it can get frustrating. Every time you get frustrated it is an opportunity to learn. Win or lose, experience is valuable.

## Chapter 2: Fundamental Moveset
Go through these exercises in training mode. Training mode will become your best friend when you're not online. Even the experts need to practice to maintain their skills, and become even better. Simple things that you may take for granted can often be improved upon. This isn't about just learning the fundamentals, this is about having them imprinted in your muscle memory. Paying attention to the small things may yield big results.

### Movement
Let's start with the basics. The very basics. Like moving the character across the screen.

Try dashing back and forth. Notice how long it takes to get up to speed, how fast you go, and how long it takes to stop. How long does it take to turn around?  Try running in one direction, then turn and stop at the same time so you’re facing the way you came from. Run up to the edge and stop without losing your balance or going over.

Pick a point on the stage, run up and try to stop exactly on that point, several times in a row. If there's a dummy on the screen, try dashing up to it and stop without touching it.

Walk around a bit by tilting the stick slowly. You can walk while the stick is all the way to the left or right, it’s a matter of how quickly you tilt. Walk back and forth, until you get a feel for exactly how fast you have to tilt in order to dash. You can slow down and speed up your walk speed once you’re walking. Use this to get in a precise position that would be hard to do while sprinting.

Fox-trot by starting to dash, returning the stick to neutral, then starting to dash again. For some characters, the start-up to the dash is quicker than the dash itself, so you can fox-trot across the screen to gain distance quickly.

Finally, try looking at the dummy, but still move your character around. Can you get a feel for where your character is without looking directly at it?
2) Jumping
Jump around. Jump up, jump up and get down.

First, do single jumps. Get a feel for how far forward and how high you can jump with just one press of the jump button. Can you land precisely where you want to? Pick a colored line on the grid and land there consistently. Jump over the dummy and try to make the highest point of the jump is directly over the dummy’s head. 

Try double jumping at different points in your jump: from immediately after the first jump, to the very top, to down to where you’ve almost landed.

Run or jump off the edge of the platform and start falling down. How far down can you go and still jump back to the stage? Get used to this, because off-stage combat is an important part of overall gameplay and you should know what it takes to get out and back.

Try jumping and tilting back at the same time. Do this several times in a row to get the feel. Most characters do a backflip when this is done right. If your jump is slightly too fast, the character will do a front jump, but in the back direction. Not the end of the world, but you won’t make it as far back. If the tilt is too fast, your character will turn around first before jumping. Try to avoid this, because you’ll end up facing the wrong direction.

Short hop by barely tapping the jump button. The short hop should be about half-height of the full jump. Try hopping in place, then moving forward as you hop. Try to run and short hop. This will come in handy later. If the opponent sees you are about to jump, doing a short jump instead of a full jump may make your opponent jump over you.

Fast fall by hitting down as you come down from a jump. This often throws off the timing of someone anticipating where you’ll land. Also, the faster you land, the faster you can run around. A little spark will appear when this is done correctly.

Lastly, like in the previous section, look at the dummy while you’re jumping around. Still try to land precisely. Set the dummy to walk and jump over it a few times while watching the dummy.

### Attacking
Finally, I get to punch someone! Some advice for attacking in general: Make your attacks intentional. Avoid flailing, attacking in random directions hoping something will hit. Train against a standing dummy, a walking dummy, then a running dummy - can you chase it down? Against the dummy, your goal should be to always land the attack, no whiffing.
#### Neutral Attacks
First, get used to your neutral attack. Attack in place without moving. Figure out what your combo looks like if you keep hitting the attack button. How quickly does it come out? How close do you have to be? On some characters you can hold down the button to keep attacking in place (until someone runs into it). Try running up to the dummy and neutral attack as quick as you can, without accidentally dash-attacking.
#### Tilt Attacks
Next, try your standing up and down tilt attacks. Make sure you can pull them off without accidentally smash attacking. While standing in place, attack overhead. How high is this attack? Can you hit someone on a platform above you? Does it hit the dummy standing next to you? Next try the down attack, or attacking while crouching. Check the range, and how quick it comes out. Try hitting the dummy both in front of you and behind you.

Tilt attacks. Do these by tilting the stick slightly, without dashing. These also come out while you’re walking. Again, check the range and speed. Some of these hit below the ground, so see if you can use it at the edge. Sometimes they are more powerful than standing neutrals.
#### Air Attacks
Air attacks. Set the dummy to jump and try hitting it in the air. Get used to all your angles, neutral, forward, up, down, and back. Some attacks will be stronger than others, so look up the moves for your character. Back air is often a tricky one to execute, so be sure to practice it.
Dash Attack
Attack as you are running forward. Most do a lot of damage, but will leave you vulnerable if you miss, so don’t rely on them too much. Pay attention to how far forward your character ends up after performing a dash attack. 
#### Smash Attacks
The namesake of the game! Up, down, left, right. High risk, high reward attacks. Use for KOing an opponent, when they’re on the brink. These take time to pull off, and will almost always be punished if you miss.
#### Short Hop Attacks
Short hop attacks. Like in the jumping section, you can short-hop and attack. Technically the jump button is hit slightly before the attack, but it’s very quick - You can do them by essentially pressing jump and attack at the same time. Do these standing in place, and from dashing forward. See how far away you should be in order for this to hit. Some characters you need to be right up against the dummy, others you have to start farther away and hit them as you’re coming down. Try dashing, then short hop and neutral air. This is a good move to have in your pocket.

### Shielding
This is your basic counter to attacks. To train, pick a cpu that uses ranged attacks, and shield to block them.
### Grabbing
You can grab either by hitting A while you’re shielded, or by pressing the bumper button. You can grab out of a run. A grab will go through the opponents shield, so use this when they think you’re going to attack and they put up their defenses.
### Dodging / Rolling
While shielding, hit down to dodge. Also while shielding, hit left or right to roll in that direction. Don’t overuse rolls! You can be badly punished while recovering from a roll. Try rolling both away from your opponent, then also towards your opponent, to end up behind them. Practice how close you have to be in order to roll towards you opponent and be on the opposite side. The last thing you want to do is roll towards your opponent, and end up in front of them facing the wrong way.

## Chapter 3: Fundamental Strategy
Remember the trifecta: Shields beat attacks, attacks beat grabs, and grabs beat shields. You will need to use all three in order to beat an opponent.

Challenge: Three stock a level 3 CPU. Don’t try to beat it. Try to hit all your moves.

Practice one move over and over. This would annoy the hell out of a human, but you can take advantage of it here.

Avoid until you see a shield, then go in for a grab.
Hit ariels in all four directions.
Hit those tilts. The C-Stick is your friend.


Smash when you are certain it’s going to hit.


Run around without dodge-rolling


Practice the forward moving, short hop, neutral air


Use ALL your moves.

Add more things to the above list when you figure them out.

Practice for however long you want, then keep in mind you’ve only been playing a CPU. Humans are very different. But by know you know some things about your character that you can have in your aresonal 


Adjust your control scheme
I would personally recommend setting the c-stick to tilts, and turn of stick jumping. This will add tilts to your arsenal and make them easy to execute. Tilts are more important than smashes, and smashes are easy enough to pull off without the c-stick. Stick jumping makes it difficult to hit your up tilts. Often instead of attacking upwards to hit an opponent above you, you jump straight into your opponent. That said, give different control schemes a try and find what best suits you.
Know your character
Strengths and weaknesses. Range. Attack strings. Strategies. 
Play the neutral game
This is when nobody is attacking, and nobody is defending. Run and jump back and forth, getting yourself in range. Use this time to come up with a plan. Can you get close enough to your opponent without them attacking? Don’t be tempted to go all out on attacks. Be patient.
Control the center of the stage
You have more options with how you execute if you can stay near the middle of the stage and move out from there.
Watch for patterns
Pay attention to how your opponent reacts when you try something. Is there a certain sequence of actions your opponent takes? Being familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing character is important as well, to know what to expect and how to avoid it.
Finish off a falling opponent
Don’t be afraid to jump off the side of the platform to hit a recovering opponent. This is the best way to finish someone off. Don’t wait for them to recover! Get comfortable jumping away from the platform then getting back.
Recover
Recover by grabbing onto the ledge, not landing on the platform. Your opponent will always be able to read where you’re going to land and punish you dearly for it. When grabbing the ledge, you have options for recovery, either attacking or jumping.
